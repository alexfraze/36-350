cat("Hello living organisms from a different exoplanet. I am another living organism from Earth. 
    Myself and the other living organisms earth would like to learn more about you and your species. 
    Would you please answer the following questions for us:
    What do you call your species? What forms of communication do you prefer to use? 
    Do you have a common set of rules or laws that you abide by? 
    What is neccessary for you to live and function? Do you have a specific purpose? 
    
    Hopefully we can establish a friendly and collaborative relationship between our two species.
